# Functional-and-Logic-Programming
My projects for the FLP course at university

### Recursive Programming
#### Lab 1

a. Determine the lowest common multiple of the elements from a list.

b. Substitute in a list, all occurrence of a value e with a value e1.

----
### Prolog
#### Lab 2

a. Write a predicate to determine the lowest common multiple of a list formed from integer numbers.

b. Write a predicate to add a value v after 1-st, 2-nd, 4-th, 8-th, ... element in a list.

#### Lab 3

a. For a list of integer numbers, define a predicate to write twice in list every prime number.

b. For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, define a predicate to write in every sublist twice every prime number.

#### Lab 4

The list a1...an is given. Write a predicate to determine all sublists strictly ascending of this list a.

----
### LISP
#### Lab 5
a. Write a function to return the product of all the numerical atoms from a list, at superficial level.

b. Write a function to replace the first occurence of an element E in a given list with an other element O.

c. Write a function to compute the result of an arithmetic expression memorised in preorder on a stack.

d. Write a function to produce the list of pairs (atom n), where atom appears for n times in the parameter list.

#### Lab 6
Convert a tree of type (2) to type (1).

#### Lab 7
Define a function that replaces one node with another one in a n-tree represented as: (root list_of_nodes_subtree1... list_of_nodes_subtreen).
